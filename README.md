# Sentiment_Analysis

The goal here is to predict the sentiment of movie review, i.e. positive or negative (binary classification).

- Process and results captured in the Jupyter notebook.
- PyCharm used to run all the modules. All the directories used have been uploaded here.
- The micro web framework Flask has been used for the front end.

Metrices monitored to ensure that the model works good are below:
- Accuracy
- Precision 
- Recall 
- F1 score

Things that need to be addressed:
- Run time of the machine learning model.
- Use inbuilt methods/ python libraries than writing code from scratch. This would likely reduce the run time.
- Improve the front end module by inculding css.
